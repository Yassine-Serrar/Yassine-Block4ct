You can start this program by double clicking on it. Then you enter one of the prompted numbers and follow the 
instructions. We created 2 seprate lists so that one of them would be the sorted list and the other would be the regular
list. If you don't to follow the instructions the application will break and you will have to restart it.

The linear binary search works by looking through each value for the right one. The recursive binary search searches for
all the vaules. 

In this program a I decided to add a calculator because I thought in a number program you would want a calculator too.
I wanted to add a way to edit the list but that proved to difficult of a task for me. I don't think the recursive binary
search works, so that would need to be fixed. I think the calculator could be better, but i like how it is right now.
